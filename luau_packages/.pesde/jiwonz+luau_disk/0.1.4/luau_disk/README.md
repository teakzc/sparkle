# Disk

A collection of functions to operate on Lua/Luau data structures as immutable data.

# Installation

Add `luau-disk` in your dependencies:

```bash
yarn add luau-disk
```

Or if you are using `npm`:

```bash
npm install luau-disk
```

## Releases

Versions of Disk are also pre-built and linked to [GitHub releases](https://github.com/seaofvoices/luau-disk/releases):

- `disk.rbxm` is a Roblox model file
- `disk-bundled.lua` is a single-file version of the library (with Luau type annotations removed)

## Other Lua Environments Support

If you would like to use this library on a Lua environment, where it is currently incompatible, open an issue (or comment on an existing one) to request the appropriate modifications.

The library uses [darklua](https://github.com/seaofvoices/darklua) to process its code.
